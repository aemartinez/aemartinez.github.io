I'm **Agustín Martínez Suñé**, a **Postdoctoral Research Associate** at the **University of Oxford**, where I work with the [OXCAV](https://oxcav.web.ox.ac.uk/) research group.

I earned my **Ph.D. in Computer Science** from the University of Buenos Aires, Argentina, specializing in **formal methods** for distributed systems analysis. My research has been published in leading venues including [TCS](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tcs.2025.115247), [FM](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-71177-0_7), and [ICTAC](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-47963-2_9), where our work was recognized with the [Best Paper Award](https://ictac2023.compsust.utec.edu.pe/) in 2023.

Building on my expertise in formal methods, I worked as a Formal Verification Engineer at [Nethermind](https://www.nethermind.io/), where I co-developed [Horus](https://github.com/NethermindEth/horus-checker), the first automated verification tool for StarkNet smart contracts. 

In 2024, I was awarded a [PIBBSS Research Fellowship](https://pibbss.ai/fellowship/) to work at the [London Initiative for Safe AI](https://www.safeai.org.uk/), where I explored approaches for integrating language models with symbolic planners to create safe LLM agents. This experience led me to focus my research on the intersection of **formal verification** and **AI safety**, with interests spanning **model checking**, **temporal logics**, **SMT solving**, **safe reinforcement learning**, and **safe LLM agents**.

My research vision is to bridge formal methods and machine learning to create trustworthy, verifiable AI systems that can be rigorously analyzed and certified.

<!-- I love all things computer science and maths.
