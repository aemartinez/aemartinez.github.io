I'm **Agustín Martinez Suñé**.

I obtained my **Computer Science Ph.D.** at the University of Buenos Aires, Argentina, where I developed **formal methods** for analyzing distributed systems. These methods are grounded in logical-mathematical foundations to provide **provable guarantees** about their output. 

I’m transitioning to a career in **AI safety** and AI risk reduction. The main question that currently drives my research is: what role can **formal verification** techniques play in the field of AI safety?

<!-- I love all things computer science and maths.

Have a look at some of my working [projects].
